iterations: The first thing I did was iterate the actual field of play a couple of times, expanding the size and adding various obstacles, adjusting until I was satisfied.
I then iterated  the variables like movement speed to find a feel that was relatively satisfying for the game.
I had to consult copilot and iterate the actual script several times to get the scoring to work, and even now it occasionally bugs in a way I don't understand, but it seems reliahle for the most part.
I attempted to make a portal game object that would teleport the player on collision, but after hours of revising, following tutorials and consulting copilot I just wasn't able to get it to work and had to scrap the idea.
design tools: I finally settled on a change to goal and skill, adding a collectible that would automatically increment the player's score by 5, but is very difficult to reach due to the parkour required.
These are the changes I made!
